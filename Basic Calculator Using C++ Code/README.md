# C++ Calculator

## Description
A simple, command-line calculator built in C++. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation, and square roots. The user can perform multiple calculations in one session.

## Features
- Supports +, -, *, /, %, ^ (power), r (square root)
- Handles invalid input and division by zero
- Allows multiple calculations in a single run

## Installation
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project folder and compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp 
    
    ./calculator - Runs the program.

## Usage
Run the calculator, and enter your desired operation in the following format:
5 + 5
9r - Used for square rooting.

## Example Output
=== C++ Calculator ===
Enter expression (e.g., 5 + 5 or 9 r): 5 + 5
Result: 10
Do another calculation? (y/n): y - ("y" means Yes, and "n" means No)
